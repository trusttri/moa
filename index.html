                    Moa is how you pronounce "모아" — which roughly means "to gather" in Korean.

                <h2>What is Moa?</h2>
                We, a research team at the University of Michigan, aim to build Moa, a software for <b><a href="https://consentful.systems">consentfully connecting</a> PhD students affected by faculty advisors’ mistreatment or abuse of power</b> — so that they can collectively discuss and navigate their situations.

                We are interviewing PhD students in computer science and information-related fields to make design decisions for Moa.

                We, a research team at the University of Michigan, are currently interviewing PhD students in computer science and information-related fields to make design decisions for Moa.

                <ul>
                    <li> The interview will take about 60-75 minutes. You will be compensated $20 per hour for your time, either as a check or virtual gift card (Amazon, Visa). </li>
                    <li> Because of the sensitiveness of the topic, we will show an imaginary scenario that depicts problematic advising dynamics and use that to anchor interview questions. This is in order to not directly ask for participants’ experiences, because for some, they could be traumatizing. (The lead author went through multiple advisor changes and wants to make sure the interview process feels comfortable and safe.) </li>
                    <li>All data will be anonymized. We will also check in with participants to see if anyone wants to exclude their answers from our research data. </li>
                    <li> This study is exempt from ongoing IRB review at the University of Michigan (HUM00246731). </li>
