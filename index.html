                We, a research team at the University of Michigan, aim to build <b>Moa, a software for <a href="https://consentful.systems">consentfully connecting</a> PhD students affected by faculty advisors’ mistreatment or abuse of power</b> — so that they can collectively discuss and navigate their situations.

                We are interviewing PhD students in Human-Computer Interaction, Information, and Computer Science to make design decisions for Moa.

<!--             <p>
                We, a research team at the University of Michigan, are currently interviewing PhD students in computer science and information-related fields to make design decisions for Moa.

                <ul>
                    <li> The interview will take about an hour. You will be compensated <b>$20 per hour</b> for your time, either as a check or virtual gift card. </li>
                    <li> We will show an imaginary scenario that depicts problematic advising dynamics and use that to anchor interview questions. This is in order to <b>not</b> directly ask for participants’ experiences. (The lead author went through multiple advisor changes and wants to make sure the interview process feels safe.) </li>
                    <li>All data will be anonymized. We will also ask participants if they want to exclude any of their answers from our research data. </li>
                    <li> This study is exempt from ongoing IRB review at the University of Michigan (HUM00246731). </li>
                    <li>We have <b>already</b> interviewed PhD students at the University of Michigan, so we are looking for PhD students <b>from other institutions</b> (i.e., if you are a U-M PhD student, you are currently <b>not</b> eligible to participate). </li>
                    <li>For now, we aim to interview PhD students in <b>CS or Information PhD programs</b>.</li>
